# Timer_Calculator-
The file **"Timer Calculator.xlsx"** is a microcontroller timer configuration sheet. It takes inputs like timer frequency (16 MHz) and prescaler (100) to calculate parameters such as timer count clock, time per tick, and period value (ARR). It helps determine settings to achieve a desired time base, e.g., 0.1 s, and is useful for STM32 microcontroller timer setup.
